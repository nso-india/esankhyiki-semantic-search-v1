  "description": "Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) is a flagship labour data product under the category of Labour Statistics, conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) to provide comprehensive insights into India’s employment and unemployment situation. Covering All India since 2017-18 to 2023-24, the survey is conducted annually and serves as the primary source for estimating major labour market indicators such as the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), Worker Population Ratio (WPR), and Unemployment Rate (UR). The PLFS captures key dimensions of the labour market, including worker distribution by employment type, industry, education, gender, social group, and sector, as well as details on earnings, working hours, and employment conditions under both Usual Status (PS+SS) and Current Weekly Status (CWS). It also reports statistics such as the percentage of regular wage/salaried employees in the non-agriculture sector, average wage and earnings, and hours worked per week across diverse socio-economic and demographic filters. The survey follows the National Metadata Structure in compliance with metadata standards for the PLFS, ensuring harmonized and comparable estimates over time. The latest dataset was last updated on 23 September 2024, and future releases are scheduled as and when released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).",

    "description": "The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) is the percentage of the population that is either working or actively seeking work. It is a key indicator of the supply of labour available for an economy's productive purposes. The LFPR is calculated for various age groups (e.g., 15 years and above), and its values are disaggregated by gender, education level, social category, and sector (rural/urban). The trend in LFPR, particularly among youth and women, is vital for understanding economic engagement, demographic dividend utilization, and the broad shifts in societal work norms. The survey uses different reference periods, such as Principal Status plus Subsidiary Status (PS+SS) or Current Weekly Status (CWS), to capture employment.",

The index is compiled by comparing the current month’s production of selected items with the average monthly production in the designated base year. Multiple base periods are used for comparability over time: 1993-94, 2004-05, and 2011-12, with each revision reflecting updates in industrial structure and product coverage. The IIP dataset spans long historical series—1994-95 to 2010-11 for the 1993-94 base, 2005-06 to 2016-17 for the 2004-05 base, and 2012-13 onwards for the 2011-12 base.

  "description": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), compiled by the Price Statistics Division, Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation, is the key measure of retail inflation in India. It tracks changes in the general level of retail prices of goods and services purchased by households for consumption. CPI and the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) are available at All India, Rural, Urban, and State levels, disaggregated by sector (Rural, Urban, Combined) to capture variations in household consumption. The series is available monthly from 2013 onwards (base 2012) and for the 2011–2014 period (base 2010), enabling consistent back series comparisons through linking factors. Coverage extends to all States and Union Territories, including major states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Maharashtra, and smaller regions such as Andaman & Nicobar, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry. The CPI dataset is structured around broad groups, subgroups, and items, including essential consumption categories such as Food and Beverages, Housing, Clothing and Footwear, Fuel and Light, and Miscellaneous. Within these, detailed subgroups (e.g., Cereals and Products, Pulses, Vegetables, Oils and Fats, Personal Care and Effects, Health, Education, Transport) and granular items (e.g., rice, wheat, pulses, milk, edible oils, fruits, vegetables, fish, eggs, meat, sugar, beverages, fuel, clothing, footwear, rent, medicines, transport services) are tracked. This layered structure allows users to study inflation trends at multiple levels of aggregation—from broad groups down to specific commodities—across time, month, sector, and geography. Key outputs include the Inflation Rate, Consumer Price Index, and Consumer Food Price Index, making CPI a foundational dataset for policy decisions, economic research, and price monitoring. The latest update is from 12 September 2025, with future releases aligned to the Advance Release Calendar 2025–26.",

This hierarchical structure helps in analyzing sectoral inflation trends across India’s states and union territories, covering regions from Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra to smaller territories like Lakshadweep and Chandigarh. Users can explore monthly and annual movements from 2011 to 2025, across rural, urban, and combined sectors, with both current and back series available for continuity.

The survey provides comprehensive information at All India and State-wise levels, capturing data on input, output, employment, fixed and working capital, assets, wages, depreciation, and value addition. The ASI dataset spans from 1992-93 to 2022-23 (excluding 1993-94), with classifications aligned to the National Industrial Classification (NIC) 1987, 1998, 2004, and 2008 to ensure consistency with evolving industrial structures. Users can analyze a wide range of industrial characteristics, including number of factories, persons engaged, wages & salaries, fuels consumed, gross and net value added, capital formation, profits, and productivity ratios. The database supports insights into time-series trends of industrial growth, structural ratios, and technical coefficients while allowing drilldowns by industry code (2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit NIC levels) and across states and union territories such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, and others.

The TUS collects data on participation and time spent in paid employment, unpaid caregiving and domestic work, volunteer services, learning, socializing, leisure, and self-care activities, enabling measurement of both SNA (System of National Accounts) and Non-SNA activities. Key statistics include participation rates (%), average time spent per participant or per person (in minutes) across paid, unpaid, and other activities, and their distribution by socio-demographic and economic characteristics such as gender, marital status, age group, education, social group, and household consumption quintile. The 2019 and 2024 TUS rounds adhere to the National Metadata Structure and comply with the metadata standards for unit-level data of TUS. The dataset includes detailed indicators on percentage and time spent across activities as major and non-major activities, disaggregated by factors such as usual principal activity status, marital status, UMPCE quintile class, education level, social group, and day type. The most recent dataset was last updated on 31 March 2025, with future releases to be published as and when released by the Ministry.",

It serves as a nationwide enumeration of all economic establishments, excluding those engaged in crop production and plantation activities, with a focus on both the organized and unorganized sectors. The dataset captures detailed information on the number of establishments, employment levels, and their distribution across geographical units (All India, States, Districts, Rural, and Urban areas). Key variables include the type of major activity, sector, nature of operation, ownership structure, and source of finance. Conducted as and when required, the 5th Economic Census (2005) represents a crucial reference point for assessing the structural composition and dynamics of India’s economic establishments. The data was last updated in April 2016, with no fixed base period applicable. As an official national data source, the Economic Census supports evidence-based policymaking and economic planning by offering a comprehensive and disaggregated view of enterprise activity across India. More information can be accessed through the National Metadata Structure.",
